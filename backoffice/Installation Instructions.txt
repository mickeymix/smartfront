1.Extract the phpcharts files to your homesite folder. The result whould be "yourhomesite/phpcharts". 

2.Copy the index.php file from the the directory "phpcharts/índex.php" to your "yourhomesite" directory. Use this index.php file instead of your own. 

3.Go into the code in the new "index.php" and change 
define("CHARTS_SOURCE", ""); 
to 
define("CHARTS_SOURCE", "phpcharts/"); 

4. Start moving your old "index.php" information to the new "index.php".

5.The directory that contains index.php must be set to CHMOD 777.
Which makes it´s possible to create chart images at real-time. 
777 signify access to read and write.
Other directories where you want to create chart images must also be set to 777.
